Dotfiles.

Used mostly on Linux. But also has a little bit of partially broken support for
WSL, ucLinux, macOS, Solaris and maybe other things.

My WSL setup is besides the Linux one the most worked on.

The setup is thus: since WSL doesn't play nice with VPNs on the Windows site (as
of this writing), I connect to VPN within WSL, and start a tinyproxy instance so
that the Windows side can connect to VPN resources through the WSL distro. Yes,
a bit backwards.
